### In this repository lives my first pyplot dashboard designed using javascript. It holds bellybutton bacteria data as well as visualizations for several volunteers. The dataset was retrieved as a JSON file from the spaceX website. In this dashboard I showcase how to create several visualizations along with a dropdown menu to change subset data to any given volunteer.
